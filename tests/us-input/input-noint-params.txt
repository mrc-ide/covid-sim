^^ This mobile phone data would be used specifically for the digital app. For households, we select x% of households and assign users according to probabilities by age. If we don't cluster by household, we multiply the probability of being a user by the probability of being a smart phone user by age. NOTE: if we set the proportion of users by age to 1 for all age groups, this means everyone can be tracked and is more similar to standard contact tracing.
