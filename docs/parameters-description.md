# Parameters

WIP - interpretations below are based on reading the SetupModel.cpp file

The parameters class contains:
- configurable options for running the simulation 
- quantitative information used in the simulation
- data produced about the setup process e.g. running totals
- variables used to load/save information
- variable used to manage processor / memory
